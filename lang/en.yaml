  desc: "The goal of this campaign is to encourage open source advocates to send personal emails to their European Parliament representatives. Pre-filling this form collects no user data, but allows you to easily edit and copy the message into your favourite LLM. From here, you can send it in your own personal email (or your work one if you prefer). We want to make this as personal and relatable as possible, so will not be using a canned message like older campaigns have been. Take it seriously, and plan to follow-up at FOSDEM when this campaign will conclude."
